# AgriChain Local

AgriChain Local is a local-first agricultural marketplace and traceability platform built with React, Express, MongoDB, Solidity, Truffle, Ganache, and Web3.js.

It lets farmers publish produce, buyers place orders with Razorpay test-mode online payments or COD, admins oversee the platform, and anyone with an order number verify the supply-chain journey through a public tracking page.

The project is designed for localhost development and demos:

- no MetaMask is required for buyers
- blockchain writes are signed by the backend
- Razorpay test mode is used for online payments during local testing and demos
- blockchain proofs are still recorded for products, orders, payment updates, and order lifecycle changes

## Overview

AgriChain Local combines three layers:

1. `frontend/`
   A React + Vite client for buyers, farmers, and admins.
2. `backend/`
   An Express API with JWT auth, MongoDB persistence, business logic, blockchain integration, analytics, and GPS simulation.
3. `blockchain/`
   A Truffle/Ganache workspace that deploys the `FarmSupplyChain` smart contract used as a proof ledger.

This project uses a backend-signed blockchain architecture:

- the backend is the blockchain writer
- Ganache is the local chain
- MongoDB stores the application state
- the smart contract stores verifiable proof events and ledger state

## Key Capabilities

- Farmer product listing with traceability fields such as batch code, origin location, harvest date, unit, quantity, and price
- Buyer marketplace, cart, and grouped checkout by farmer
- Razorpay test-mode online payments and local `COD` collection flow
- Buyer profile management with photo, address, pincode, phone extension, role, and bio
- Order records that snapshot buyer delivery details and farmer contact details
- Buyer order history with cancellation and payment retry flows
- Farmer order handling for confirm, ship, and out-for-delivery transitions
- Public order tracking by order number
- Farm address and buyer delivery address shown during tracking
- Admin dashboard with users, products, orders, revenue, and analytics access
- GPS simulation for `out_for_delivery` orders
- Automatic blockchain re-sync for local products when the backend starts against an empty chain

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- React 18
- React Router
- Vite
- Axios
- React Toastify
- Recharts
- Leaflet / React Leaflet

### Backend

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB + Mongoose
- JWT authentication
- Web3.js
- Morgan
- CORS

### Blockchain

- Solidity `0.8.19`
- Truffle
- Ganache

## How The System Works

### 1. Product publishing

- Farmers create products in MongoDB.
- The backend records the product on-chain using the backend signer account.
- The product stores:
  - blockchain product id
  - initial blockchain transaction hash
  - latest blockchain transaction hash

### 2. Order creation

- Buyers check out from the cart.
- Checkout requires:
  - email
  - mobile extension
  - mobile number
  - address / place
  - state
  - country
  - pincode
- The backend creates order records in MongoDB and records proof data on-chain.
- Each order snapshots:
  - buyer delivery details
  - farmer contact details
  - payment method
  - payment status
  - order status

### 3. Payment flow

- Online payments run through Razorpay test mode.
- `COD` is still local and marked collected when delivery is confirmed.
- Payment state changes are also written to the blockchain proof ledger.

### 4. Tracking

- Public tracking is available at `/track/:orderNumber`.
- The tracking page shows:
  - product details
  - order lifecycle timeline
  - blockchain proof hashes
  - farm details
  - buyer delivery details
- When an order is `out_for_delivery`, the backend GPS simulator updates coordinates every 5 seconds.

### 5. Startup helpers

On backend startup, the server:

- connects to MongoDB
- ensures the default admin user exists
- attempts to re-sync local products to an empty blockchain
- starts GPS simulation for delivery orders

## Order Lifecycle

### Razorpay test flow

1. Buyer places an order with `paymentMethod=upi`
2. Backend records the order on-chain with payment status `pending`
3. Buyer opens Razorpay Checkout in test mode
4. Backend verifies the Razorpay signature and records the payment update on-chain
5. Farmer confirms the order after successful payment
6. Farmer marks it shipped
7. Farmer marks it out for delivery
8. Buyer confirms delivery

### COD flow

1. Buyer places an order with `paymentMethod=cod`
2. Backend records the order on-chain
3. Farmer confirms the order
4. Farmer marks it shipped
5. Farmer marks it out for delivery
6. Buyer confirms delivery
7. Backend marks COD as `collected` and records that proof on-chain

### Cancellation

- Buyers can cancel eligible pending orders
- cancellation is recorded on-chain
- product stock is restored in MongoDB

## Blockchain Smart Contract

The deployed contract is `FarmSupplyChain`.

It records proof-ledger state for:

- product creation
- product update
- product deactivation
- order creation
- payment recording
- order status updates
- order cancellation
- COD collection

Core contract event types:

- `ProductRecorded`
- `ProductUpdated`
- `ProductDeactivated`
- `OrderRecorded`
- `PaymentRecorded`
- `OrderStatusUpdated`
- `OrderCancelled`
- `CodCollected`

## Local URLs

- Frontend: `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- Backend API: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api`
- Backend health: `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health`
- Ganache RPC: `http://127.0.0.1:7545`
- MongoDB: `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/agri-blockchain`

## Prerequisites

Install these locally before running the project:

- Node.js 18+ recommended
- npm
- MongoDB running locally
- Ganache CLI via project dependency

Out of the box, the project works without:

- MetaMask
- a public blockchain
- a live payment gateway account

## Environment Variables

### Backend: `backend/.env`

Copy from `backend/.env.example`.

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/agri-blockchain
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
CLIENT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173
GANACHE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7545
CONTRACT_NETWORK_ID=1337
CHAIN_ID=1337
BLOCKCHAIN_SIGNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_test_key_secret
ADMIN_NAME=Platform Admin
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@agri.local
ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123!
```

Razorpay test keys are required if you want to use the online payment flow.

### Frontend: `frontend/.env`

Create this file if it does not exist:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
```

### Blockchain: `blockchain/.env`

Copy from `blockchain/.env.example` if needed by your local tooling:

```env
GANACHE_HOST=127.0.0.1
GANACHE_PORT=7545
CONTRACT_NETWORK_ID=1337
```

## Getting Started

Open separate terminals for blockchain, backend, and frontend.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd blockchain
npm install

cd ..\\backend
npm install

cd ..\\frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Start Ganache

```bash
cd blockchain
npm run ganache
```

This starts a local chain on `127.0.0.1:7545` using the configured deterministic mnemonic and local database folder.

### 3. Deploy the smart contract

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd blockchain
npm run reset
```

Useful blockchain commands:

```bash
npm run compile
npm run migrate
npm run reset
npm run test
```

### 4. Start MongoDB

Make sure MongoDB is running locally at:

```text
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
```

### 5. Start the backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

Or use watch mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will:

- connect to MongoDB
- seed the default admin user if missing
- sync products to the blockchain if the chain is empty
- start GPS simulation for `out_for_delivery` orders

### 6. Start the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5173
```

## Default Admin Account

By default the backend seeds an admin user from environment variables.

Default values:

- Email: `admin@agri.local`
- Password: `Admin123!`

If you change `ADMIN_EMAIL` or `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `backend/.env`, the seeded credentials change as well.

## Resetting Local State

If you want to start fresh:

1. stop frontend and backend
2. stop Ganache
3. drop the `agri-blockchain` MongoDB database
4. restart Ganache with `npm run ganache` inside `blockchain`
5. redeploy the contract with `npm run reset` inside `blockchain`
6. restart the backend
7. restart the frontend

## Helpful Notes

### Admin pages are not opening

For the best experience, make sure:

- you are logged in as an admin account
- backend is running
- frontend is pointing to the correct backend URL

Admin pages:

- `/admin`
- `/admin/analytics`

### Public tracking is empty

Check that:

- the order exists in MongoDB
- you are using the correct `orderNumber`
- backend is running

### Blockchain errors after reset

After resetting Ganache or redeploying the contract, this flow keeps everything aligned:

- run `npm run reset` in `blockchain`
- restart the backend
- refresh the frontend

The backend tries to re-sync products to an empty chain at startup.

### Checkout says delivery details are required

Checkout is designed to capture:

- email
- mobile extension
- mobile number
- address / place
- state
- country
- pincode

You can prefill these from the profile page before opening the cart.

### MongoDB connection issues

Make sure MongoDB is running locally at:

```text
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/agri-blockchain
```

### Large frontend build warning

The Vite production build currently completes successfully. A future code-splitting pass can make the production bundle even leaner.
